# APK Release

This page exposes the latest APK and its release notes. The APK is fetched from a private repository by a GitHub Actions workflow and written into `assets/apks/`. Release notes are written to `_includes/release_notes.md` and included below so the site shows them automatically.

- **Latest APK:** [Download latest APK](/assets/apks/app-latest.apk)
